41,Julian,This restaurant is totally unprofessional...I have ordered food on new year...we ordered total 4 different dishes from 4 different application out of which 2were veg and 2 were non-veg and the restaurant mixed all the orders and also there was no proper packaging which led to leakage of gravies out of the container mixing the veg and non-veg...on complaining to zomato the zomato immediately cancelled and refunded our order. After an hour the restaurant person called and starting shouting rubbish things and gave bad words to us very disrespectful just because we complained. They also told us that we will come to your house. They totally spoiled our new year without even realizing their mistake.please kindly remove this restaurant from your listing zomato,Emp_005,Employee 5
